Assignment 4: D3 visualizations
===============================

Build a visualization using both R and D3. The goal here is to mimic as closely as possible graphics built under both platforms so you can evaluate how to generate the same visualization using either approach. You can use a dataset previously explored in this class or a new data set. It does not have to be a super-duper fancy D3 visualization with all the bells and whistles (aka I don't expect to see it on NYTimes.com).

Grading
-------

Your visualization will be evaluated based on the level of skill and variety of techniques employed. For example, including transitions/interactive components are more advanced skills and would be favorably evaluated. Likewise, incorporating custom CSS styles or generating a geospatial or network visualization would also be good. A basic scatterplot or bar chart is not necessarily a walk in the park and would merit a passing grade, but top scores will be reserved for those who show extensive capabilities.

Submission details
------------------

Submit your R visualization as an R Markdown document and your D3 visualization as an HTML file containing all the JavaScript and CSS code necessary to render the visualization.[1] If you wish, you can store the CSS in an external file. Your folder in the repo should also contain a copy of the generated data file.

Your submission is due by **1:30pm on Wednesday, May 24th**.

[1] Use the examples from the D3 textbook for how to build this code.
