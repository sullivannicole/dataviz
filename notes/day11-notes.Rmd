# Structuring interactivity

## Visual information-seeking mantra

> Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand

This mantra first coined by Ben Schneiderman (a professor of computer science) can be seen as a succinct summary of the purpose of data visualization:

1. Present the most important figures or most relevant points to the audience
1. Allow readers to dig into the information, explore, and come up with their own stories

Interactivity enhances our ability to accomplish the second point by presenting a structured way for readers to interact and explore the data, without having to know research design, computer programming, or other substantial technical skills that are a hurdle for the average reader. There are several design guidelines we can keep in mind as we design interactive graphics to keep them orderly and useful (rather than introducing interactivity that is pointless, confusing, or misleading).

### Linear vs non-linear

Some visualizations will be **linear** - each step of the presentation depends on understanding the previous one. Others will be **non-linear**, giving the reader a choice in navigation and the direction of the story.

![Think "choose your own adventure" stories.](http://www.liketotally80s.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/choose-your-own-adventure.jpg)

Both approaches should utilize an introduction to setup the question and topic, but diverge quickly in the possible options the reader can explore.

### Interaction techniques

* Scroll and pan
* Zoom
* Open and close
* Sort and rearrange
* Search and filter

# Examples of interactive graphics

## Central limit theorem

> [Central Limit Theorem Visualized in D3](http://blog.vctr.me/posts/central-limit-theorem.html)

* Interactive animation designed to teach the **central limit theorem**
* Every time the ball his a triangle it has a 50/50 chance of going to the left or right (i.e. a coin flip)
* As the animation plays out, the balls are sorted into bins which start to form a normal distribution
* Very linear format - user controls very little of the animation
    * Can adjust the **delay** - rate at which balls fall
    * **Bins** - number of bins into which the balls can fall

## Seeing theory

> [Seeing Theory: A visual introduction to probability and statistics](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/)

* Makes heavy use of a linear format to teach basic statistical principles
* Lots of animations
* Pan and scroll down the page to the next demonstration module
* [Open and close](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/basic-probability/index.html#third)
    * Open definitions of different estimation terms (bias, variance, mean squared error)

## The changing American diet

> [The Changing American Diet](http://flowingdata.com/2016/05/17/the-changing-american-diet/)

* Very linear structure
* Animation used to identify change over time by shifting foods up and down based on relative frequency
* Direct controls for user
    * Speed
    * Scale
* Still situated within an article setting up the question and explaining the results - graphic does not stand alone (but it could)

## How (un)popular is Donald Trump?

> [How popular/unpopular is Donald Trump?](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/)

* More of a standalone graphic
* Linear (but also non-linear) structure
* Open/close to see all the individual data points used to generate the trendline
* Open/close to see exact data point values
* Zoom in and out on different time periods

## Gun deaths in America

> [Gun Deaths in America](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/)

* Highly linearized storyline
* Animation goes from description to description
* Ends with an interaction where users can search and filter by different variables
* What is the benefit to making this interactive?

## You draw it

> [You Draw It: Just How Bad Is the Drug Overdose Epidemic?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/14/upshot/drug-overdose-epidemic-you-draw-it.html)

* Linear structure
* Allows users to "fill in" the missing years, rather than just presenting the answer
* How does interactivity enhance this visualization?
    * Allows users to explicitly confront misperceptions they have about major causes of death in the United States
* Uses open and close windows to present details about deaths at the county-level on a cartogram

## Movie explorer

> [Movie explorer](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/movie-explorer.html)

* Example of `shiny` app
* Non-linear structure - user has complete freedom to change the inputs
* Can change variables on the graph's axes
* Hover over data points on graph to get more details
* Can expand the size of the graph
* Better situated with an accompanying article/post describing the data and perhaps highlighting some noteworthy trends

## Revenue effect of restoring the tax-preferred status

> [Revenue Effect of Restoring the Tax-Preferred Status of Over-the-Counter Drugs Purchased Through Health Savings Accounts, Flexible Spending Accounts, and Health Reimbusement Arrangements through the Repeal of Section 9003 of the Affordable Care Act.](https://bensoltoff.shinyapps.io/otc-tax/)

* Widget designed for think tank in conjunction with policy report on a tax reform bill
* Changing inputs creates a new "user model" projecting the estimated revenue effect of the tax policy given varying assumptions about the state of the world
* As inputs change, graph is redrawn and table is updated
* Hovering over data points on the graph identifies the annual expected revenue effect for each model, rather than pasting it in as a table
* Clicking on the legend hides/reveals different models
* Built using `shiny`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, and Excel(!)

## America's public bible

> [Americaâ€™s Public Bible: Biblical Quotations in U.S. Newspapers](http://americaspublicbible.org/)

* Digital humanities project
* Combines linear and non-linear structure
* On front page, open and close used to provide exact values for data points
* [Exploration](http://americaspublicbible.org/exploration.html)
    * Embeds a Shiny application for examining use over time of different bible verses
    * Search and filter
    * Pan and zoom

# Interactive graphics in R

`ggplot2` does not have built-in interactivity. The successor to `ggplot2`, [`ggvis`](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/), is still in development and not ready for production-level graphics.

However we can still build interactive graphics within the R environment. This is accomplished by a series of packages that generate [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) visualizations directly within R. JavaScript is a core technology within the World Wide Web framework, and is used to render websites. The majority of the demonstration visualizations above were created using JavaScript.

To build these types of graphs, we could shift entirely to an interactive graphics library based on Javascript, such as [D3](https://d3js.org/), and write all of our code in that format. The drawbacks to this approach are:

* Learning another programming language is time-consuming
* D3 visualizations are typically meant for presenting visualizations in their final form, not quickly rendering exploratory graphs, so there is a lot of unnecessary code-writing involved.
    * Think about how `ggplot()` makes many default assumptions when you write code to generate a graph. Normally the defaults work correctly, but you can always override them if necessary. With D3 and other JavaScript libraries, you cannot rely on these defaults.

## `htmlwidgets`

`htmlwidgets` is a framework for creating R bindings to JavaScript libraries. In essence, packages built on this framework take the R code that you write, process it, and convert it to the appropriate JavaScript code. From here, you can view the resulting graph in RStudio like an ordinary plot, embed it within an R Markdown document, or save it as a standalone `.html` page to share with others or post online.

Some of the packages we will explore this week are built using `htmlwidgets`; others use their own approach to bind R functions onto JavaScript libraries.

## `plotly`

[Plotly](https://plot.ly/) is an online analytics and data visualization tool built using Python, JavaScript, and D3. They offer a commercial product for designing graphics via a point-and-click interface online, but have developed open-source packages for generating plotly graphs ([plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/)), as well as API libraries for generating plotly graphs in [R](https://plot.ly/r/).

### `ggplotly()`

`ggplot2` can be readily converted into interactive graphics in `plotly` through the use of `ggplotly()`:

```{r ggplotly-scatter}
library(plotly)

# basic scatterplot
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point()

ggplotly(p)

# add color
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class))

ggplotly(p)

# add smoothing line
ggplotly(p +
           geom_smooth())

# add vehicle labels to tooltips
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class, text = str_c(manufacturer, model, sep = " "))) +
  geom_smooth()

ggplotly(p)
```

```{r bubble}
# dahl bubbleplot
dahl <- read_dta("data/LittleDahl.dta")
dahl_mod <-lm(nulls ~ age + tenure + unified, data = dahl)

dahl_augment <- dahl %>%
  mutate(hat = hatvalues(dahl_mod),
         student = rstudent(dahl_mod),
         cooksd = cooks.distance(dahl_mod))

# use size
p <- ggplot(dahl_augment, aes(hat, student)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(size = cooksd,
                 text = str_c(Congress, "Session of Congress", sep = " ")),
             shape = 1) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1, 20)) +
  labs(title = "Regression diagnostics for Dahl model",
       x = "Leverage",
       y = "Studentized residual") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

ggplotly(p)
```

#### Modifying `ggplotly()` objects

```{r ggplotly-str}
str(plotly_build(p), max.level = 2)
```

`ggplotly()` stores all the components of the graph in a list object in R, which you can directly access using `plotly_build()`. To modify components of the `ggplotly()` object, "simply" modify the appropriate element in `plotly_build()`. Let's use the OTC tax widget as an example, converting it into a non-Shiny object.^[In fact this is the exact trouble I went through when building the app. It's easier to work on the graph portion in a static environment first, before incorporating the Shiny components.]

```{r otc, code = readLines("plotly-otc.R"), eval = FALSE}
```

# Session Info {.toc-ignore}

```{r cache = FALSE}
devtools::session_info()
```
