Q1: Visualization critique
================

The data visualization I selected is the US ENERGY PRODUCTION THROUGH THE YEARS given by the government (<https://energy.gov/maps/energy-production-over-years>).

In this plot, the size of the circle represents the production of a single energy of the corresponding state on the map. We can choose different types of energy and different year by the tab above the map. We can see the total amount of production on top and the particular amount of a state by clicking the circles.

Following the critiques, I should say this one is quite truthful. As the plot is drawn according to the data given by the government and it just describes the amount of production by the size of circles, the plot should be quite objective and it reflects the truth. Also, it’s quite functional. You can compare the production of states easily by comparing the size of the circle. The geographic difference of energy production is clear. The specific amount of information can be seen by clicking the circles. For this data visualization, I wouldn’t say it’s beautiful. But it is definitely concise and, at least, not ugly.

However, I don’t think this data visualization is insightful. Although it conveys the data quite clearly to the audiences, it doesn’t provide with us any insight information. For example, we cannot know why there is such a difference of energy production across the states. Also, we cannot know why there is a change through the years. By clicking the tags above the map, we can see the data of different years, but we are not able to compare the situation in different years easily. It is more like a reflection of cross-section data rather than the visualization of data through many years. Moreover, the difference of distribution for different energy should probably be explained. In other words, it is not quite enlightening as it only reflects the truth (the data) but doesn’t include the explanation of the situation.

Another thing I would like to mention is that I noticed there are two circles in the ocean (in the lower-left and lower-right of the map). I thought the plot was to show the production of energy of different states (as other circles are for states). Obviously, this two circles in ocean do not represent two states. So it’s a little bit confusing. The data visualization should probably make it clear its goal is to show the difference among states or areas. If it is for states (as they said in the title), then what is this two large circles?

To improve this data visualization, I would do a few things. Firstly, I would enable the audience to select the energies they would like to show on the plot. Different types of energy should be differentiated by color. For instance, the audience can select crude oil and coal, then both will be shown on the map. But they will be shown in different color. In order to compare the data through the years, I would make a line plot to show the amount of energy production of a single state through the years. This is definitely a good way to show the trend through years.

To sum up, this is a good data visualization. It reflects the truth, we can see the data readily. But it lacks the explanation for the data. We cannot make an easy comparison among different years, different states and different type of energy.
