Is it truthful?
------
The data is sourced from OnTheIssues.org, which utilizes direct quotes from political figures to ascertain their views on social and economic issues. Truthfulness is relatively high for this visualization, as the year from which the first time point of data stems from is notated for each politician profiled. This offers an accountable and transparent narrative of the data that allows for a more nuanced comparsion to be made among points. However, one point in which truthfulness is less than ideal is that the labels of "populism" and "libertarianism" are somewhat obscured by two things: the subjective nature of OnTheIssues.org's assessments of these rankings, and the fact that these words are operationalized on the chart as representing more academic political concepts as opposed to layperson usage. So while the chart attempts to draw forward the narrative that Donald Trump has gotten increasingly less populistic, the associated article on [the Five Thirty Eight website](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sorry-bloomberg-trump-is-already-a-third-party-candidate/) instead conceptualizes populism as being espoused by collectivist economic ideas such as an increased tax on the most wealthy as opposed to the more social and cultural populism espoused by Trump on the campaign trail. When crucial axes of the graph are rendered obscure by language with a more academic and less inuitive connotation, it is harder for viewers to grasp the facts and ideas at play. Additionally, the axes are represented clearly and truthfully, with no major exclusions or jumps.


Is it functional?
----

A weak point of this graph is its functionality. As described above, the way in which populism is defined may be unclear. While its existance in opposition to libertarianism is sound historically given the political history of such figures as William Jennings Bryan and his populist crusade towards government action to relieve the burdens of the poor, the average person can't be expected to jog their memory of that history. The differences in social and economic populism are also somewhat difficult to grasp -- especially in the case of Donald Trump, where his economic policies are linked to anti-cosmopolitianism, isolationism, and even nationalism. This also holds true for Bernie Sanders, whose populist economic policies are supplemented by a positive view of multiculturalism. The functionality of this chart comes out best when you can evaluate the spaces between the candidates, as even someone confused by the axes and terms would be able to clearly see the point being made about how three politicians who were relatively centrist at least a decade ago have gravitated towards more partisan views. While the way in which movement across time is demonstrated would be difficult to understand without a key, the key provided does a stellar job at conveying this information. While Donald Trump (and, to a slightly lesser extent, Bernie Sanders) has now moved to more integral role in the American system, the majority of these candidates were seen as "outsider" candidates when this was published in January 2016. Simply reporting the OnTheIssues.org data for more recognizable political figures such as Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Jeb Bush, Paul Ryan, etc. would allow for a more intuitive understanding of not only where these figures lie in relation to each other, but also to their more formally political contemporaries.


Is it beautiful?
---

I believe that this graph is incredibly beautiful due to its pleasing geometric qualities. Much of this is due to the decision to use a diamond as opposed to a square. With a diamond, the chart has a more dynamic sense of space, with an extreme (at least for American politics) left-wing candidate such as Sanders being spatially located at an extreme position on the graph that is nonetheless still aligned with the center. Additionally, the use of color allows for the points showing the most recent data to pop when compared to the red/blue filled in spaces that denote traditional Democrat and Republican space. These colors are all the more effective when compared with the grey points that represent earlier timepoint data about political orientation as well as the grey fillings that represent centrist territory. The meaningful pop of colors in this graph combined with the geometric properties it used provides an informative and beautiful image to the viewer.


Is it insightful?
---

As discussed above, the outsider-nature of these candidates at press time means that it may not have been incredibly signficiant for them to be compared only in relation to each other. The profound role of personality and media in American politics means that even within left/right dichotomies often the most meaningful criterion we can compare someone to is another individual. For example, in the primary season Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton made a lot of meaning out of which of the two of them was more of a progressive. The Sanders campaign was incredibly effective in this regard as many felt that the two candidates were incredibly different despite the vast amount of common ground between them. Thus, if there was a point that might show where Hillary Clinton was today or ten years ago, it would allow the viewer to not only assess how Sanders and Clinton have changed, but also how they differ relative to each other.  Thus, while this graph does provide insight, a lack of contextualizing data limits it efficacy as an insightful document.


Is it enlightening?
---

In its own context, the core message of this graph is that the three candidates, who at the time were all seen as potential third party candidates, shared the attribute of being centrists who had become more radical over time. Specifically, this image is meant to highlight Bloomberg's trasnformation from liberal Republican to Obama-aligned liberal Democrat. Now that the election is over, we can generally likely agree that Bloomberg's role, save for throwing some strong punches towards Trump on Clinton's behalf, was pretty limited. However, this graphic does provide an enlighting insight about Donald Trump which is more poignant than any of the other data: his adaptability and versatility. His pivot from liberal-leaning moderate to nationalistic conversative is the largest of the three, and provides clues to his eventual victory in the general election as he courted evangelicals, moderate Republicans, and isolationists by constantly transforming his image and policy interests.
