```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Libraries
library(rcfss)
library(tidyverse)
data("scorecard")
```

Initially, I wanted to explore if there is a relationship between the admision rate and the type of institution. 

```{r}
ggplot(scorecard) +
       geom_col(aes(type, admrate))
```

Not time for more. I am a slow worker :(.
