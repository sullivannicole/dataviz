  Description
    Abstract:
      This is an ArcView shapefile of State-wide school districts
      for Oklahoma State. Boundaries are based on information provided 
      by the Oklahoma Department of Education. This State-wide shape 
      file is created by dissolving the State-wide school districts shape file 
      on the Av_sdcode attribute field.
    Purpose:
      This school district data set was prepared by the Center for Spatial Analysis 
      at the University of Oklahoma in cooperation with the Oklahoma State 
      Department of Education and Oklahoma Tax Commission Ad Valorem 
      Division for the purpose of capturing data related to the public school 
      district boundaries for the State of Oklahoma.

  Attribute_Accuracy
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The attribute information contains school district names and ad valorem school 
      district code particular to each individual school district within a county as 
      verified by the Oklahoma State Department of Education and Oklahoma Tax Commission.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
      The school district boundaries were originally derived from TIGER/Line
      2000 files of the Bureau of the Census. TIGER/Line files were originally 
      digitized at a scale of 1:100,000 to an accuracy of 160 ft. School District 
      boundaries were verified against school district maps provided by the Oklahoma 
      State Department of Education. Updates and corrections to those boundaries are 
      continually made as necessary.
  Completeness_Report:
    The compiler embodies the syntax of the 1998 version of the Content Standard 
    for Digital Geospatial Metadata, known as FGDC-STD-001-1998 and also supports 
    the Biological Data Profile of that standard, FGDC-STD-001.1-1999. Local extensions 
    to the standard are permitted and a mechanism is provided 
    that allows these extensions to be described to the compiler.
